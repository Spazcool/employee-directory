# Employee Directory
A simple demo app of an employee directory, including the ability to filter & sort the available data. A user can view an entire employee directory at once, allowing quick access to their desired information. Built with React, this app demonstrates its core ideas: breaking the UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events.
